TW: Violence, Suicide, Transphobia

On Nov 20th, a vigil was held outside of the Portland Building on UoN's University Park campus to commemorate Transgender Day of Remembrance
This was an event I was planning on attending in a personal capacity originally, but I later felt that it was a topic that deserved attention.

Izzy Morris and I from [URN](https://urn1350.net) carried out some interviews with attendees and organisers during and after this event. It was an incredibly touching experience.
Later featured on an episode of "The Pulse" (URN's daily news discussion show) this report features some of these interviews alongside an overview of my experiences during what was an emotional event.

I hope that the report does this important issue justice, and that it brings more attention to the tragedy of trans deaths due to suicide and violence.
