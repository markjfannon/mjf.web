I'm glad to announce that after appearing as a panelist on "The Pulse", a news discussion show on [University Radio Nottingham](https://urn1350.net).  

I'll be on between 5-6pm on Wednesdays, be sure to tune in as I find myself placed in the big chair. After spending the last semester with the URN News Team, I'm beyond chuffed that I've been given this opportunity.
