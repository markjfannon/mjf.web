Glad to announce that my first 2 articles for [The Mic](https://themicmagazine.co.uk) music magazine have been published and they are as follows!

- [Gaz Coombes - Turn The Car Around (Album Review)](https://www.themicmagazine.co.uk/post/gaz-coombes-turn-the-car-around)
- [Classics Revisited - The Dark Side of the Moon Revisited](https://www.themicmagazine.co.uk/post/classics-revisited-pink-floyd-dark-side-of-the-moon)

This is my first journey into proper music journalism (or journalism at all really) so I hope that they are coherent enough! 

Hopefully more to come!
